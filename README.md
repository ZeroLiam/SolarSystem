# SolarSystem
A render of the Solar System in WebGL.

## Motivation
Made by Rosemary Adejoh and Liselot Ramirez, as the bonus assignment for the Computer Graphics class in Bauhaus University during the Winter Semester 2018/19.

This project is based on the semester-long homework done in OpenGL, so the core rendering that you see here is what we've done in the last couple of months.

## Build status
Currently under construction. Delivery date: Jan 31st 2019 (**31.01.2019**).

## Code style
Mainly standard JavaScript ES6 (also known as ES2015).

## Screenshots
TBA

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [WebGL:](https://get.webgl.org/) _a cross-platform, royalty-free API used to create 3D graphics in a Web browser._
- [Browserify:](http://browserify.org/) _an open-source JavaScript tool that allows developers to write Node.js-style modules that compile for use in the browser._
- [Babel:](https://babeljs.io/) _a JavaScript compiler that makes new JS versions compatible with current browsers_
- [Node:](https://nodejs.org/en/) _a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine._

## Features
1. Uses ES6 for development
2. Interactive
3. Can be viewed live in an external site: [https://adejohramirezsolarsystem.netlify.com/](https://adejohramirezsolarsystem.netlify.com/)
4. Following the example of our previous OpenGL program, the "_classes_" from C++ are the _modules_ we use in JavaScript.

## Installation
1. Please `git clone`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Install local server with `npm install -g serve`
    - Open terminal in the current directory
    - Run the server with `npm run start` so you can see what is going on
      - In case `npm run start` throws you an error, try to install all the dependencies manually once again, running the following in the root folder of this project: `npm i browserify eslint prettier reading-time babel-core babel-preset-es2015 browserify-livereload watchify`
    - Once `npm run start` works, by default it goes to `http://localhost:5000/`
    - Copy and paste the localhost link in your browser
    - Enjoy our app

## How to use?
Well, this is a final homework. If you submit this as  your own, well... you're f*cked.

If out of curiosity you want to start your own project based on this little one, go ahead!
